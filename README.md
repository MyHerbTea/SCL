# Bridging Domains: Self-Cooperative Learning with Dual-View Pooling for Robust STS

## About This Repository

This repository will host the official implementation of our paper: "Bridging Domains: Self-Cooperative Learning with Dual-View Pooling for Robust Semantic Textual Similarity." Our research introduces a novel Self-Cooperative Learning (SCL) framework that effectively bridges the gap between general and specialized domains for improved Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) performance.

## Code Release Plan

**Note**: The code is coming soon...

## Research Overview

Our approach addresses key challenges in STS tasks through several innovations:

- **Dual-View Pooling Mechanism**: Enables effective collaboration between bi-encoders and cross-encoders
- **Multi-Round Iterative Learning Algorithm**: Dynamically optimizes pooling strategies and training sample selection
- **Unsupervised Learning Framework**: Functions without labeled data, making it suitable for low-resource scenarios

Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly narrows the performance gap between general and specialized domains and achieves substantial improvements in specialized fields such as medicine.


Stay tuned for the full code release!
