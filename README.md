# Bridging Domains: Self-Cooperative Learning with Dual-View Pooling for Robust STS

## About This Repository

This repository will host the official implementation of our paper: "Bridging Domains: Self-Cooperative Learning with Dual-View Pooling for Robust Semantic Textual Similarity." Our research introduces a novel Self-Cooperative Learning (SCL) framework that effectively bridges the gap between general and specialized domains for improved Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) performance.

## Code Release Plan

**Note**: The complete codebase and associated resources will be publicly released after the paper is formally accepted for publication in an academic conference or journal. We are committed to open-sourcing all implementation details immediately following publication to facilitate community engagement and research reproducibility.

## Research Overview

Our approach addresses key challenges in STS tasks through several innovations:

- **Dual-View Pooling Mechanism**: Enables effective collaboration between bi-encoders and cross-encoders
- **Multi-Round Iterative Learning Algorithm**: Dynamically optimizes pooling strategies and training sample selection
- **Unsupervised Learning Framework**: Functions without labeled data, making it suitable for low-resource scenarios

Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly narrows the performance gap between general and specialized domains (from 25.13 to 9.39 points) and achieves substantial improvements in specialized fields such as medicine (55.20% for bi-encoders and 164.97% for cross-encoders).

## Upcoming Resources

Upon code release, this repository will include:

- Complete source code for model implementation
- Pre-trained models and weights
- Data preprocessing scripts
- Reproduction guides
- Evaluation toolkit
